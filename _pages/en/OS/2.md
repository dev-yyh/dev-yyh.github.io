# PCB(Process Control Block)
---

The `PCB(Process Control Bolock)` is where the operating system stores information to control the process, and is a data structure that stores the status information of the process.

In an operating system, a process is represented by a PCB. 

Each time a process is created, a unique PCB is created, and when the process is completed, the PCB is also removed.

Depending on your operating system, what your PCB includes may vary, but it typically includes the following information:

- **Pointer**
    - Pointer information that stores the current location of the process.

- **Process Status**
    - Stores each state of the process (New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated).

- **Process Number**
    - Every process is assigned a unique ID called Process ID or PID which stores the process identifier.

- **Program Counter**
    - Stores a counter containing the address of the next instruction to be executed for the process.

- **Register**
    - Information in CPU registers, including accumulator, base, registers, and general purpose registers.

- **Memory Limitations**
    - This field contains information about the memory management system used by the operating system.Â This may include page tables, segment tables, etc.

- **List of open files**
    - This information includes **list of open files** for the process.

# Process table
---

The operating system manages the PCB for each process using a process table to quickly access the PCB.

- The process table consists of a collection of PID and PCB.
- The process table uses the process's unique identifier, commonly called the process ID (PID), to quickly find the PCB associated with a specific process.
- The process table is required for `process state management` and `context switch`.
