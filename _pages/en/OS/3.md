`Context` refers to the state information of the process.

`Context switch` is the operation of exchanging process state information.

Context switching allows multiple processes to share and utilize a single CPU's resources.

# What is a context switch?
---

Context switching involves storing the state of a previous process and reading information from another process and loading it into registers so that another process can use the CPU while one process is using it.
The state of a process is kept in the `process control block (PCB)`.

This allows the system to run multiple processes at the same time by quickly switching between them.

This transition is so fast that even on a single CPU it gives the illusion of parallel processing.

## The role of context switching in multitasking
---

Multitasking (=multiprocessing) is made possible through context switching.
- Multitasking: Multiple processes sharing and using one CPU resource

The reason multiple processes appear to be running simultaneously on a single CPU is because context switching is happening quickly.

This time is called `overhead` because no other work can be done during the context switch.

## Overhead solution
---

No actual processing occurs during context switching. 
The CPU simply saves and loads process state, which can impact performance, especially if context switches occur frequently.

Overhead solutions include:
1. Reduce multiprogramming
    - You can reduce the frequency of context switches by limiting the number of processes running simultaneously.
2. Stack-Oriented Processing
    - On systems using stack-based processing, context switching can be performed by changing the stack pointer register, which is more efficient.
3. Use threads to minimize context switching overhead
    - Threads are lighter than processes, so they require less context to switch between, thus reducing overhead.

## When context exchange occurs
---

When context switching occurs:
- **Multi-tasking**Â 
    - In a multitasking environment, the scheduler can switch processes when one process must yield the CPU to another. In a preemptive system, the scheduler can stop a process and switch to another process.
- **Interrupt handling**
    - When an interrupt occurs, the hardware automatically switches part of the context. This transition is usually minimized to reduce the time required to handle the interrupt.
- **Switch between user and kernel modes**
    - Context switching can occur when the operating system needs to switch between user mode and kernel mode.
