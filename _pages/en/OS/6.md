# Understanding Inter-Process Communication (IPC): The Key to Seamless Process Collaboration
---

In the computing world, multiple processes often run simultaneously, performing different tasks.
To understand how these processes interact, we can classify them into two types:

1. Independent process:
    - It is a process that cannot affect or be affected by other processes. Independent processes do not share data.

2. Cooperating process:
    - A process that can influence or be influenced by other processes. Collaborative processes share data.

## Why collaborative processes are powerful
---
The collaborative process has the following benefits:
1. Information sharing:
    - Multiple users can share information by sending and receiving status or data.
2. Speed ​​up calculations
    - Speed ​​can be increased because multiple processes process tasks in parallel at the same time.
3. Modularity
    - You can build your system in a modular way by dividing system functions into separate processes or threads.
4. Convenience
    - It becomes easier to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, creating a more efficient and responsive system.

A cooperative process to effectively share information requires a mechanism called `inter-process communication (IPC)`.

## What is Interprocess Communication (IPC)?
---

`IPC` is a method of data exchange between collaborating processes. This allows processes to communicate and share information seamlessly. IPC has two basic models:

1. Shared memory
2. Message passing

## Shared memory
---

In the `shared memory` model, processes communicate by sharing a portion of memory. This shared space allows data to be read and written directly, allowing information to be exchanged very quickly.

### Advantages
- Speed:
    - This model is faster than the message passing model because the process accesses shared memory directly, eliminating the need to pass data through an intermediary.

### disadvantage
- Synchronization challenges:
    - Even if process A passes data to shared memory, process B cannot know about it. This requires an additional synchronization mechanism to keep everything in sync.

## Message passing
---

The `message passing` model involves sending and receiving messages over dedicated channels in kernel memory. This model is ideal for situations where a controlled method is needed to exchange information in a process.

### Advantages
- Built-in control features:
    - The kernel manages data exchange, so no additional synchronization mechanism is required. The kernel ensures that messages are delivered reliably.

### disadvantage
- Speed:
    - This method is generally slower than shared memory because the data has to pass through the kernel.

There are two types of message passing:

1. Direct Communication
    - This is a method of directly delivering messages by explicitly indicating the name of the process you wish to communicate with.

2. Indirect Communication
    - This is a method of indirectly delivering messages through intermediate objects (mailbox, message queue, channel).

## Select the correct IPC model
---

- The choice between shared memory and message passing depends on your specific requirements. 
If you prioritize speed and can manage synchronization, `shared memory` is ideal.
If you need a more controlled and secure exchange of information, we recommend using `message passing`.
