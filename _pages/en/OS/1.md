# Understanding process memory structures and state transition
---

The relationships between programs, processes, and processors play a crucial role in how a computer system executes tasks. A **program** refers to a set of instructions written by a programmer to perform a specific task, whereas a **process** refers to a program in execution. The **processor (CPU)** is the hardware component that runs the process.

In this post, we will explore the process memory structure and the transitions between different process states.

## Program
---

A program is a collection of sets of instructions given to a computer to perform a task.

The program is stored in an auxiliary memory device (disk) and may be an executable file such as Excel or Notepad. It includes not only compiled results but also source code written by the programmer.

Below is a simple program written in C language.

```c
void main() {
  printf("Hello\n");
}
```

## Process
---

A process refers to a program that is running, and is also called a job or task. 

The moment a program is loaded into memory, it becomes a process.

## Processor
---

This is the hardware (=CPU) that allows the process to run.

*Action: Program resources are loaded into memory and the memory address of the code to be executed is loaded into the CPU's register.

## Process memory structure
---

The process memory structure can be divided into four sections: stack, heap, data and text.

Data is divided into uninitialized data (bss) and initialized data.

#### Stack 
- This is where temporary data is stored. Example) Local variables, parameters
- Because the size is determined at compile time, infinite allocation is not possible, and a stack overflow error occurs if the stack area is exceeded.

#### Heap 
- This is where dynamically allocated data is stored, and the size is determined at runtime. Example) malloc

#### Data
- Uninitialized data (bss) - This is where uninitialized variables (global variables, static variables) are stored.
- Initialized data - This is where initialized variables (global variables, static variables) are stored.

#### Text(Code) 
- This is where the program code is stored.
- It is decided at compile time and is designated as Read-Only so that the code cannot be changed midway.

## process status
---

As the process runs, it undergoes the following five state changes.

1. **New**
    - The program is in auxiliary memory to create a process.
2. **Ready**
    - The program is loaded into main memory and becomes a process. Processes in the ready state are waiting to be executed by the CPU and are waiting in a queue.
3. **Running**
    - The CPU is executing the process.
4. **Waiting (or Block)**
    - This refers to a state in which a process is waiting for an event, such as completion of input/output or reception of a signal.
5. **Terminated**
    - The process is completely terminated.

## Process state transition
---

The state transition process of the process is as follows.

![Process state transition](/assets/img/posts/OS/1/3.webp "Process state transition"){:class="img-lg"}
1. Dispatch (ready -> running) 
    - This is the process of selecting one process among several processes and assigning it to the CPU.
2. Interrupt (running -> ready) 
    - When the allocated CPU time expires, a Timeout Interrupt occurs, transferring the CPU to another process and transitioning to the Ready state.
3. Block (running -> waiting) 
    - This is the process of transitioning from running to waiting state to wait for resources such as I/O to be allocated because they cannot be allocated immediately after requesting resources such as I/O.
    - Blocks occur because I/O processing is handled by the I/O process, not the CPU.
4. Wakeup (waiting -> ready) 
    - Once the necessary resources are allocated, the process transitions to the ready state.
