# Process Synchronization: Mutual Exclusion
---

Have you ever thought about the problems that occur when multiple people try to edit the same document simultaneously? Similar situations happen in computers as well. When multiple processes attempt to access the same resource at the same time, unexpected errors or data corruption can occur. To prevent this, the concept of **mutual exclusion** is necessary. In this article, we will systematically explore the concept of mutual exclusion, the requirements for implementing it, and examples of violations.

## What Is Mutual Exclusion?
---

**Mutual exclusion** is an algorithm that prevents two or more processes from entering the **critical section (CS)** simultaneously. The critical section refers to the part of the code that accesses or modifies shared resources. By using mutual exclusion, processes can safely use shared resources and prevent issues like **race conditions**.

## Basic Operations for Mutual Exclusion
---

Two basic operations are used to implement mutual exclusion.

### `enterCS()`

- Before entering the critical section, it checks if another process is already in the critical section.
- If another process is in the critical section, it waits until it becomes free.

### `exitCS()`

- Performs post-processing when exiting the critical section.
- Indicates that it has exited the critical section so other processes can enter.

## Three Requirements for Mutual Exclusion
---

To correctly implement mutual exclusion, the following three conditions must be satisfied.

### 1. Mutual Exclusion

- If one process is in the critical section, other processes must not be able to enter.
- No two processes can be in the critical section simultaneously.

### 2. Progress

- If no process is in the critical section, any process that wishes to enter should be able to do so immediately.
- Processes outside the critical section should not prevent others from entering.

### 3. Bounded Waiting

- Each process must be able to enter the critical section within a finite amount of time.
- Prevents **starvation** by avoiding infinite waiting.

## Analysis of Requirement Violations
---

When implementing mutual exclusion, problems can arise if the above requirements are not properly met. Let's examine some examples to understand how these requirements can be violated.

### Case 1: Violation of Progress

**Code Example:**

```c
// Shared variable
int turn = 0; // 0: Process A's turn, 1: Process B's turn

// Process A
function enterCS():
    while (turn != 0):
        wait()
    // Critical section code execution

function exitCS():
    turn = 1

// Process B
function enterCS():
    while (turn != 1):
        wait()
    // Critical section code execution

function exitCS():
    turn = 0
```

#### Explanation:

1. **Process A** has not entered the critical section, but the `turn` value is set to `0`.
2. **Process B** cannot enter the critical section even though it is free because of the `turn` value.

#### Problem:

- Since no process is in the critical section but others cannot enter, the **progress** requirement is violated.
- There's an issue where a process cannot enter the critical section twice in a row.

### Case 2: Violation of Mutual Exclusion

**Code Example:**

```c
// Shared variables
boolean flagA = false;
boolean flagB = false;

// Process A
function enterCS():
    flagA = true
    while (flagB == true):
        wait()
    // Critical section code execution

function exitCS():
    flagA = false

// Process B
function enterCS():
    flagB = true
    while (flagA == true):
        wait()
    // Critical section code execution

function exitCS():
    flagB = false
```

#### Explanation:

1. **Process A** sets `flagA` to `true` in `enterCS()` and enters the `while` loop but is preempted at this point.
2. **Process B** sets `flagB` to `true` in `enterCS()` and bypasses the `while` loop to enter the critical section.
3. **Process A** resumes execution, bypasses the `while` loop, and enters the critical section.

#### Problem:

- Both processes enter the critical section simultaneously, violating the **mutual exclusion** requirement.

### Case 3: Violation of Bounded Waiting and Progress

**Code Example:**

```c
// Shared variables
boolean flagA = false;
boolean flagB = false;

// Process A
function enterCS():
    flagA = true
    while (flagB == true):
        flagA = false
        wait()
        flagA = true
    // Critical section code execution

function exitCS():
    flagA = false

// Process B
function enterCS():
    flagB = true
    while (flagA == true):
        flagB = false
        wait()
        flagB = true
    // Critical section code execution

function exitCS():
    flagB = false
```

#### Explanation:

1. **Process A** sets `flagA` to `true` and is preempted before entering the `while` loop.
2. **Process B** sets `flagB` to `true` and enters the `while` loop.
3. **Process A** resumes and enters the `while` loop.

#### Problem:

- Both processes repeatedly check each other's flags, setting and resetting them, resulting in an infinite loop.
- This violates the **bounded waiting** requirement, and since no one can enter the critical section even when it's free, the **progress** requirement is also violated.

## Conclusion
---

Mutual exclusion is a crucial concept in process synchronization, and the three requirements must be satisfied for correct implementation. However, slight differences in preemption or variable settings during implementation can lead to requirement violations.

To address these issues, various algorithms have been developed. Among them, **Dekker's Algorithm** is known as the first algorithm to satisfy the mutual exclusion requirement. In actual systems, more advanced synchronization techniques like semaphores and monitors are used to implement mutual exclusion.
