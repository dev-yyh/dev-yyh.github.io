# Process synchronization: Find out about critical section & race condition
---

If multiple processes use the same data at the same time, data inconsistency problems may occur.

To prevent this, we use an important concept called `process synchronization`.
Process synchronization is a mechanism that determines the execution order between processes so that shared data can be used safely without conflict when multiple processes use it.

Among them, we will look at two important concepts: `critical section` and `race condition`.

## Critical section
---

A `critical section` is an area of ​​code that can only be accessed by one process at a time.

The process is generally divided into four code areas:

```text
do {

  entry section

    critical section 

  exit section

    remainder section	

} while (TRUE);
```

1. **entry section**
    - This is an area that requests entry permission to enter the critical area. Apply a `lock` to prevent access by other processes.
2. **critical section**
    - This is an area that only one process can access.
3. **exit section**
    - This is an area that notifies when it no longer exists in the critical area. Releases the lock to allow other processes to enter.
4. **remainer section**
    - This is an area where tasks unrelated to the critical section are performed.

More than one process cannot access the critical section at the same time. 
Therefore, each process must request permission to enter from the entry section in order to enter the critical section. If another process is already working in the critical section, it waits in the entry section and then enters the critical section when it receives a signal from the exit section that it can enter. You must synchronize by entering.

If multiple processes access the critical section at the same time, problems such as a `race condition` may occur.

## Race condition
---

A `race condition` is a situation in which execution results vary depending on the execution order when multiple processes access shared data simultaneously.

Let's assume that two threads each increment the value of a global variable by 1. Here the global variable becomes the critical section.

The ideal sequence of operations is as follows:

![Race condition ideal](/assets/img/posts/OS/7/1.webp "Race condition ideal"){:class="img-lg"}

The two threads each increment the value of the global variable by 1, resulting in the value 2, as expected.

Here's a problematic situation:
![Race condition problem](/assets/img/posts/OS/7/2.webp "Race condition problem"){:class="img-lg"}

You can see that the final result is 1, not 2.

If you access the same shared area and perform operations at the same time as above, a race condition will occur and consistency will be broken.

## How can we solve this?
---

To prevent this race condition, synchronization operations such as `Mutual Exclusion` are required.
This ensures that only one process can access the critical section at a time. This helps ensure data consistency.
