# What is a Thread Pool?
---

`Thread Pool` is a set of threads created in advance to process tasks in a program in parallel.

By using the Thread Pool, you can reuse threads that have already been created rather than creating a new thread every time work is needed, thereby reducing the overhead caused by thread creation and destruction. 
This optimizes performance and enables efficient use of system resources.

## Thread Pool Structure

1. Thread Pool
	- A Thread Pool is a set of multiple threads. These threads are pre-spawned and ready to perform work whenever work is queued.
2. Task Queue
	- Task Queue is a queue where tasks to be processed are waiting. As new tasks arise, they are added to this queue. Task Queue is responsible for providing tasks for threads to process.
3. Completed Tasks
	- Once a task is completed, the completed task is moved to `Completed Tasks`. This area records the tasks successfully performed by each thread.

## How Thread Pool works
---

1. Reset
    - When a program starts, a certain number of threads are created and registered in the Thread Pool.
2. Add tasks
    - When a task occurs, it is added to the task queue.
3. Perform threaded tasks
    - One of the threads in the pool takes a task from the work queue and performs it.
4. Thread reuse
    - A thread that has completed a task is not destroyed and waits for new tasks in the task queue again.

## Advantages of Thread Pool
---

1. Performance optimization
    - Reduces the overhead of repeatedly creating and destroying threads.
2. Efficient resource management
    - Only an appropriate number of threads are used, allowing efficient use of system resources.
3. Controllability
    - You can ensure system stability by limiting the number of threads running simultaneously.

## Disadvantages of Thread Pool
---

1. Difficulty setting Thread Pool size
    - Setting the Thread Pool size appropriately is a difficult task. If it is too small, it may limit the number of tasks that can be processed simultaneously, which may increase latency; if it is too large, it may waste system resources.
    - The thread pool size must be adjusted according to the state of the system and the characteristics of the task, which requires experience and tuning.
2. Resource contention
    - Contention can occur when multiple threads try to access the same resource (e.g. memory, file, network, etc.) at the same time. This may cause poor performance or deadlock.
3. Difficulty ensuring work processing order
    - When using Thread Pool, it is difficult to guarantee the processing order of tasks. Tasks may not be processed in the order they were queued, and it is difficult to guarantee the priority of specific tasks.

## Common use cases of Thread pool
---

1. Web server
    - Web servers often use a thread pool to manage incoming client requests. Each request can be processed by a thread in the pool, ensuring fast response times and efficient resource management.
2. Database connection pool
    - Database-based applications often use thread pools to manage connections. Each thread processes a database query or transaction, reducing the overhead of establishing a new connection.
