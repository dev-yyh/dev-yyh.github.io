# REST API vs SOAP API
---

An API (Application Programming Interface) is an intermediary that enables interaction between different software systems. APIs are a core element of modern software development and are widely used as a means of communication in web applications. The two main API communication methods are **REST (Representational State Transfer)** and **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**.

In this article, we will understand the differences between REST API and SOAP API through their characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, and examples.

## REST API
---

**REST API** is a simple method for defining resources on the web and performing operations on those resources. It is designed to allow clients and servers to exchange data using HTTP requests. REST is implemented based on the fundamental principles of the web and primarily uses JSON or XML formats to send and receive data.

### Key Features:
1. **Statelessness**: The server does not store the client's state; each request should be complete and independent.
2. **Resource-Based**: REST is designed around resources, and each resource is identified by a unique URI.
3. **Use of HTTP Methods**: REST API performs operations on resources by mapping CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
4. **Standardized Response Formats**: Generally uses **JSON** format to transmit response data, but can also use other formats like XML.
5. **Cacheable**: Clients can cache server responses, which helps in performance optimization.

### REST API Example
Below is a simple example of requests and responses for a REST API that handles user information.

#### Retrieve User Information (GET Request)
```http
GET /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Accept: application/json
```

#### Response
```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

#### Create User (POST Request)
```http
POST /users HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane.doe@example.com"
}
```

#### Response
```json
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 124,
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane.doe@example.com"
}
```

### Advantages and Disadvantages of REST

#### Advantages:
- **Flexibility**: REST uses HTTP and JSON, making it easy to implement across various platforms.
- **Statelessness**: The server does not need to store state, which enhances scalability.
- **Cacheable**: REST responses can be cached, which is advantageous for performance optimization.
- **Standardization**: Provides intuitive and standardized design using HTTP methods and status codes.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Security**: Data can be easily exposed if HTTPS is not used by default.
- **Fixed Methods**: Methods for CRUD operations are fixed, which may not be suitable for complex business logic.
- **Handling Large Messages**: Large requests and responses can impact network performance.

## SOAP API
---
**SOAP API** is a communication protocol mainly used in enterprise applications. It uses XML to send and receive messages and provides more security features and adherence to standards.

![SOAP](/assets/img/posts/Backend/1/2.webp "SOAP")

### Key Features:
1. **XML-Based**: All data is structured in XML, providing platform and language independence.
2. **WS-Security**: An API focused on security, maintaining security during data transmission using the WS-Security standard.
3. **Standardized Protocol**: SOAP is based on W3C standards and includes various standards like messaging, security, and transaction management.
4. **Supports Multiple Protocols**: Supports various transport protocols like HTTP, SMTP, TCP, providing flexible communication methods.
5. **Contract-Based**: Service contracts are defined through WSDL (Web Services Description Language), and clients and servers interact based on this contract.

### SOAP API Example
SOAP API calls are generally composed of XML messages. Below is a simple SOAP request and response example.

#### SOAP Request
```xml
POST /WeatherService HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: length
SOAPAction: "http://www.example.com/GetWeather"

<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope" xmlns:wea="http://www.example.com/weather">
   <soap:Header/>
   <soap:Body>
      <wea:GetWeather>
         <wea:City>New York</wea:City>
      </wea:GetWeather>
   </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

#### SOAP Response
```xml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: length

<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope">
   <soap:Body>
      <GetWeatherResponse xmlns="http://www.example.com/weather">
         <GetWeatherResult>
            <Temperature>22</Temperature>
            <Condition>Sunny</Condition>
         </GetWeatherResult>
      </GetWeatherResponse>
   </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

### Advantages and Disadvantages of SOAP

#### Advantages:
- **Security**: Provides a high level of security through the WS-Security standard.
- **Standardization**: Defines the service interface using WSDL (Web Services Description Language).
- **Supports Various Transport Protocols**: Offers flexible communication methods by supporting HTTP, SMTP, TCP, etc.
- **Transaction Support**: Supports ACID transactions, enhancing stability.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Complexity**: The XML-based message structure is relatively heavy and may have slower processing speeds.
- **Lack of Flexibility**: Compared to REST, the design is more rigid and may be disadvantageous in scalability.
- **Slower Processing Speed**: Due to the complexity of the XML structure, data processing speed may be slower compared to REST API.

## Comparison of REST vs SOAP

| **Feature**        | **REST API**                                 | **SOAP API**                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Protocol**       | HTTP                                         | Supports various protocols (HTTP, SMTP, etc.)|
| **Data Format**    | Mainly JSON, also supports XML               | XML only                                     |
| **Security**       | Basic HTTP security (SSL/TLS)                | Provides advanced security features with WS-Security |
| **Statefulness**   | Stateless                                    | Can be stateless or stateful                 |
| **Performance**    | Lightweight with fast response times         | Heavy and complex, relatively slower         |
| **Standardization**| No clear standard                            | Follows strict standards (WSDL)              |
| **Error Handling** | Uses HTTP status codes                       | Uses SOAP fault objects                      |

## Which API Should You Choose?
---

### When to Choose REST API
- When network bandwidth is important, such as in mobile apps or web applications
- When rapid development and flexibility are needed
- When standardized security is not essential

### When to Choose SOAP API
- In cases where high levels of security and reliability are required, such as finance or healthcare
- When complex transactions and state management are needed
- When integration with existing SOAP-based systems is necessary

## Conclusion
---

REST API is widely used in web applications due to its lightweight and fast performance, making it suitable for mobile and web communications. On the other hand, SOAP API is more commonly used in enterprise environments where high security and transaction management are required. Each API method can be selected according to the situation and requirements, and REST and SOAP can be used together as needed.
