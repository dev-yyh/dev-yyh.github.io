# Learn about Tree
---

## What is a tree?
---

A tree is a non-linear hierarchical data structure where nodes are connected like tree branches.
The tree resembles a tree turned upside down, like this:

![Tree](/assets/img/posts/DS/8/1.webp "Tree"){:class="img-lg"}

A tree is also a recursive data structure, with subtrees within the tree and subtrees within those subtrees.
A computer's directory structure can be a representative example of a tree structure.

1. **Node**
    - Basic elements that make up the tree
    - A node contains a key or value and a pointer to a child node.
    - Node: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J

2. **Edge**
    - Connection lines between nodes

3. **Root Node**
    - Top node with no parent in a tree structure
    - Root Node: A

4. **Parent Node**
    - Node with child nodes
    - Parent node of H, I: D

5. **Child node**
    - Child nodes of parent node
    - Child nodes of node D: H, I

6. **Sibling node**
    - Nodes with the same parent
    - F, G are sibling nodes

7. **External node, outer node, terminal node, leaf node**
    - Nodes without child nodes
    - H, I, J, F, G

8. **Internal node, inner node, non-terminal node, branch node**
    - Node with one or more child nodes
    - A, B, C, D, E

9. **depth**
    - Number of edges from the root to a certain node
    - Depth of root node: 0
    - Depth of D: 2

10. **Height**
    - Number of edges in the longest path from any node to a leaf node
    - Height of leaf nodes: 0
    - Height of A node: 3

11. **Level**
    - Number of edges from the root to a certain node

12. **Degree**
    - Number of children of a node
    - Leaf node degree: 0
    - degree of A: 2

13. **Path**
    - Order of nodes along the path from one node to another
    - A&H route: A-B-D-H

14. **Path Length**
    - Total number of nodes on the path
    - A&H path length: 4

15. **Size**
    - Number of descendant nodes including itself
    - Size of node B: 6

16. **Width**
    - Number of nodes in the level
    - Level 2 width: 4

17. **Breadth**
    - Number of leaf nodes
    - Breadth: 5

18. **Distance**
    - Number of edges on the shortest path between two nodes
    - Distance between D and J: 3

19. **Order**
    - Maximum number of children a parent node can have
    - Order 3: This means that a parent node can have up to 3 children.

## characteristic
---

Trees have the following characteristics:

1. **Single Root Node**: 
    - It consists of one root node and zero or more subtrees.
2. **Nonlinear structure**:
    - It is a non-linear data structure because data is not stored sequentially.
3. **Recursive properties**:
    - It is a recursive data structure with another tree within a tree.
4. **No cycle**:
    - It is a connected undirected graph structure without a simple loop.
5. **Hierarchical Relationship**:
    - It is a hierarchical data structure with parent-child relationships between nodes, and every child node has only one parent node.
6. **Nodes and Edges**:
    - A tree with n nodes always has n-1 edges.

## Example for non-tree cases
---

Not all connected graphs qualify as trees. For example, a structure with multiple root nodes or cycles is not a tree.

1. It is not a tree because it has two root nodes (2, 8).
    ![Not Tree](/assets/img/posts/DS/8/6.webp "Not Tree"){:class="img-md"}
2. Node 6 has two parent nodes (8,5) and forms a cycle (2-8-6-5), so it is not a tree.

## Tree type
---

1. **Skew tree**
    - It is a tree where every node has only one child.
    - When it has only one child in the left direction, it is called a left skew tree, and when it has only one child in the right direction, it is called a right skew tree.

    ![Skew tree](/assets/img/posts/DS/8/8.webp "Skew tree"){:class="img-lg"}

2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
    - An ordered binary tree.
    - The left child of a node must have a value less than its parent's value, and the right child of a node must have a value greater than its parent's value.

3. **m-way search tree**
    - A search tree with up to m subtrees.
    - It is an extended form of the binary search tree and is used to reduce the height.

4. **Balanced Tree (B-Tree)**
    - This is a tree that maintains height balance in the m-circle search tree.
    - Also called height-balanced m-way tree.

## Use cases for trees
---

1. Hierarchical data storage
    - Trees are used to store data in a hierarchical structure. 
    - For example, files and folders are stored in the form of a hierarchical tree.

2. Efficient search speed
    - Uses tree structure for efficient insertion, deletion and searching.

3. Heap
    - Heap is also a tree data structure.

4. Database indexing
    - Trees are used to implement database indexing.
    - Example) B-Tree, B+Tree, AVL-Tree..

5.Try
    - A special kind of tree used to store dictionaries.
