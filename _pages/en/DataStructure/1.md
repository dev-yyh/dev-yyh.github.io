# What is Data Structure?
---

`Data structure` is a method of organizing and storing data on a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
How data is stored and accessed can have a significant impact on algorithm performance, making data structure selection an important decision in software development.

## Why are data structures important?
Efficient data storage and retrieval is essential to any application.
Whether you are building a simple program or a complex system, the choice of data structure determines how quickly and effectively the program can perform its tasks.

Using the right data structures allows for more efficient algorithms, reducing the time and resources required to process data.

## Classification of data structures
---
Data structures are generally classified into two main categories:

### 1. Linear Data Structure
---

In a linear data structure, elements are arranged sequentially, one after the other.
This arrangement allows you to easily navigate the structure and access each element in a simple way.

Representative examples include `list`, `stack`, `queue`, and `deque`.

- `List`
    - A collection of elements where each element is connected to its successor. Lists can be arrays, linked lists, or dynamic lists.
- `Stack`
    - Stack follows the last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle. The last element added to the stack is removed first.
- `Queue`
    - Queues follow the FIFO (first-in-first-out) principle. The first element added to the queue is the first element removed.
- `Deque`
    - Deque is similar to queue, but elements can be inserted and removed from both ends.

#### Features of linear data structures
1. Sequential arrangement
    - Elements are stored in a sequential manner, making traversal simple.
2. Single-level representation
    - All elements are at the same level, so you can traverse them all in a single pass.
3. Ease of implementation
    - The memory is organized in a linear fashion, making this structure easier to implement.
4. 1:1 data relationship
    - Each element has a direct relationship with its predecessor and successor, creating a one-to-one context.

### 2. Non-linear Data Structure
---

In non-linear data structures, elements are arranged hierarchically.
This means that one element can be linked to multiple elements at different levels.
Nonlinear structures are more complex and allow for more sophisticated relationships between data elements.

Representative examples include `tree` and `graph`.

- `tree`
    - A hierarchical structure in which each node is connected to one or more child nodes, forming a parent-child relationship.
- `Graph`
    - It is a network of nodes connected by edges. Graphs can represent complex relationships without a strict hierarchy, allowing for multiple connections between nodes.

#### Features of non-linear data structures

1. Hierarchical arrangement
    - Elements are linked in a hierarchy, making relationships between data more complex.
2. Multi-level expression
    - Due to the hierarchical nature of the structure, traversal often requires multiple steps.
3. Complex implementation
    - Implementing non-linear structures is usually more complex due to complex relationships between elements.
4. 1:n or n:m data relationship
    - Elements can have one-to-many or many-to-many relationships, allowing for more diverse data connections.
