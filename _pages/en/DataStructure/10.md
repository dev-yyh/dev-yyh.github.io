# Tree Traversal: Pre-order, In-order, Post-order, and Level-order Traversals
---

Tree traversal is a method of visiting nodes in a specific order, and each method can be applied to solve various problems. In this article, we will explore the four tree traversal methods: **Pre-order Traversal**, **In-order Traversal**, **Post-order Traversal**, and **Level-order Traversal**.

## What is Tree Traversal?
---

**Tree Traversal** refers to the process of systematically visiting every node in a tree structure exactly once. This is fundamental in various operations like processing the tree's data or finding nodes that meet specific conditions.

The main purposes of tree traversal are:

- **Data Processing**: Reading or modifying the data of each node.
- **Searching**: Finding specific values or exploring nodes that meet certain conditions.
- **Copying and Transforming**: Duplicating the tree or converting it into another structure.

The methods of tree traversal are:

1. Pre-order Traversal
2. In-order Traversal
3. Post-order Traversal
4. Level-order Traversal

## 1. Pre-order Traversal
---

Pre-order traversal visits the **root node** first, then the **left child**, and finally the **right child**. This method is useful for outputting the structure of the tree or duplicating it.

### Order of Pre-order Traversal:
1. Visit the root node.
2. Perform pre-order traversal on the left subtree.
3. Perform pre-order traversal on the right subtree.

In the diagram above, the result of pre-order traversal is `A, B, D, E, C, F, G`.

### Pre-order Traversal Algorithm (Recursive):
```python
def pre_order(node):
    if node:
        print(node.value, end=' ')  # Visit root
        pre_order(node.left)        # Visit left subtree
        pre_order(node.right)       # Visit right subtree
```

### Characteristics of Pre-order Traversal:
- Since the root is visited first, it's useful for duplicating the tree structure or converting expressions to prefix notation.
- Commonly used when exploring directory structures in file systems.

## 2. In-order Traversal
---

In-order traversal visits the **left child** first, then the **root node**, and finally the **right child**. This method plays a crucial role in binary search trees, allowing nodes to be sorted in ascending order.

### Order of In-order Traversal:
1. Perform in-order traversal on the left subtree.
2. Visit the root node.
3. Perform in-order traversal on the right subtree.

In the diagram above, the result of in-order traversal is `D, B, E, A, F, C, G`.

### In-order Traversal Algorithm (Recursive):
```python
def in_order(node):
    if node:
        in_order(node.left)         # Visit left subtree
        print(node.value, end=' ')  # Visit root
        in_order(node.right)        # Visit right subtree
```

### Characteristics of In-order Traversal:
- In a binary search tree, in-order traversal outputs values in **sorted order**.
- Often used when you need to output the tree structure in order or obtain sorted data.

## 3. Post-order Traversal
---

Post-order traversal visits both the **left child** and **right child** first, and then the **root node** last. This method is useful when you need to process all child nodes before the parent node.

### Order of Post-order Traversal:
1. Perform post-order traversal on the left subtree.
2. Perform post-order traversal on the right subtree.
3. Visit the root node.

![Post-order Traversal](/assets/img/posts/DS/10/3.webp "Post-order Traversal"){:class="img-lg"}

In the diagram above, the result of post-order traversal is `D, E, B, F, G, C, A`.

### Post-order Traversal Algorithm (Recursive):
```python
def post_order(node):
    if node:
        post_order(node.left)       # Visit left subtree
        post_order(node.right)      # Visit right subtree
        print(node.value, end=' ')  # Visit root
```

### Characteristics of Post-order Traversal:
- Since child nodes are processed before the parent node, it's suitable for tasks like deleting tree structures or memory deallocation.
- Often used when deleting directory structures in computer systems.

## 4. Level-order Traversal
---

Level-order traversal visits nodes **by their level** in the tree, starting from the root node at the highest level and moving down one level at a time. This method is implemented using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.

### Order of Level-order Traversal:
1. Visit the root node.
2. Visit the nodes at the next level from left to right.
3. Repeat this process for all levels.

![Level-order Traversal](/assets/img/posts/DS/10/4.webp "Level-order Traversal"){:class="img-lg"}

In the diagram above, the result of level-order traversal is `A, B, C, D, E, F, G`.

### Level-order Traversal Algorithm (Using a Queue):
```python
from collections import deque

def level_order(node):
    if not node:
        return
    queue = deque([node])
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        print(current.value, end=' ')
        if current.left:
            queue.append(current.left)
        if current.right:
            queue.append(current.right)
```

### Characteristics of Level-order Traversal:
- Since it visits nodes based on the tree's height, it's suitable for problems like **finding the shortest path**.
- Used in data structures like binary heaps and is useful when nodes need to be processed based on their width.

| **Pre-order**        | Root → Left Child → Right Child         | Visits the root node first                    | Copying tree structures, recursive problem solving |
| **In-order**         | Left Child → Root → Right Child         | Visits nodes in sorted order in BST           | Sorting values in a binary search tree |
| **Post-order**       | Left Child → Right Child → Root         | Processes child nodes before parent nodes     | Tree deletion, memory deallocation   |
| **Level-order**      | Visits nodes from left to right by level | Breadth-First Search, implemented using a queue | Shortest path search, width-based search |
