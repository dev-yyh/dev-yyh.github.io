# Learn about linked list
---
To manage data efficiently, fixed-size arrays have limitations.

Unlike arrays, which require contiguous space in memory, a linked list is a creative data structure that connects nodes with pointers. 

Linked lists are very flexible and dynamic because they do not need to be stored in a single block of memory like arrays.

## What is a linked list?
---

A linked list is a data structure that implements a list using `links` between nodes consisting of data and points.

Linked lists were created to compensate for the shortcomings of the fixed size of arrays, and unlike arrays, linked lists are not stored in a contiguous memory space, so they require linking.

A linked list connects each node using pointers, as shown below.

- `Head`: The starting point of the list.
- `Node`: Each node contains data and has a pointer called `Next` to connect to the next node.
- `Last Node`: Indicates the end of the list and points to `NULL`.


## Linked list time complexity
---

### Access: `O(n)`
Unlike an array, accessing the elements of a linked list requires traversing the list from the Head until the desired node is reached.
In the worst case, the entire list must be traversed, which can result in a time complexity of `O(n)`. Where n is the number of elements in the list.

### Search: `O(n)`
Similar to accessing an element, retrieving a specific value from a linked list requires traversing from the Head to the node containing the value.
In the worst case, the entire list must be traversed, which can result in a time complexity of `O(n)`.

### Insert:
- **Insert at beginning `O(1)`**
     - Inserting an element at the beginning of a linked list is simple. Simply create a new node, adjust the pointer so that the new node points to the old head, and then update the head with this new node. This operation is performed in constant time `O(1)`.
- **Insert in the middle `O(n)`**
     - To insert an element at a specific position, you first have to move the list to that position (`O(n)`) and then adjust the pointer (`O(1)`). The overall time complexity remains `O(n)`.
- **Insertion at the end: `O(n)` if the last element is unknown, `O(1)` if the last element is known.**
     - Inserting at the end of a singly linked list usually requires a traversal to find the last node, unless there is a tail pointer that directly references the last node. If you use a tail pointer, the operation is `O(1)`. Otherwise it would be `O(n)` due to the required traversal.

### Delete:
- **initially delete `O(1)`**
     - Deleting an element from the beginning of a linked list is simple. Updating Head to point to the second node in the list effectively removes the first node. This takes constant time `O(1)`.
- **Deletion in the middle `O(n)`**
     - To delete a node in the middle, you need to find the node (`O(n)`) and update the pointer (`O(1)`). The overall time complexity remains `O(n)`.
- **Deletion from the end: `O(n)` if the last element is unknown, `O(1)` if the last element is known.**
     - Deleting the last node requires traversing to the second-to-last node, unless a pointer to the previous node is maintained. If you use a pointer to the second-to-last node, the operation is `O(1)`. Otherwise it would be `O(n)` due to the required traversal.

## Advantages and disadvantages of linked list
---

### Advantages
1. Variable in size:
    - Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow or shrink in size freely as memory allows.
2. Easy insertion and deletion
    - You can insert or delete nodes by just updating a few pointers, without having to move elements like in an array.

### disadvantage
1. Only sequential access is possible
     - There is no indexing, so to access elements you have to access them sequentially from the beginning.
2. Requires additional memory
     - Each node requires additional memory to store pointers, which may consume more space.

## Looking at the types of linked lists
---

Depending on the direction of connection, linked lists include `single linked list`, `double linked list`, and `circular linked list`.

### Singly Linked Linear List

In its simplest form, it is a `unidirectionally` linked list of nodes.

> - Since it is a one-way connection, the node only knows the next node and does not know the previous node.
> - The pointer of the last node is set to `NULL`.

### Doubly Linked Linear List

It is a list where nodes are connected in `both directions`. Each node has two pointers to the next node and the previous node.

> - Because it is a two-way connection, you can freely navigate back and forth between nodes.
> - Since each node has two pointers, additional memory is required compared to a simple linked list.

### Circularly Linked Linear List

- It is a `circular` structure that connects the last node and the first node in a general linked list.

> - The pointer of the last node is connected to the first node, forming a `loop`.
> - Suitable for circular structures. Example) Round robin scheduling

## When should you use a linked list?
---

1. Dynamic memory allocation:
     - Suitable for data structures whose size changes dynamically.
2. Frequent insertion and deletion operations:
     - Suitable for frequent insertion and deletion operations.
3. Sparse data structures
     - Linked lists are suitable for sparse data structures because they store only the data that is actually needed.
