# Learn about queues

## What is a queue?
---

A queue is a linear data structure that stores data in a `FIFO (First In First Out)` structure where the data put in first comes out first.
A real-life example is similar to a situation where the person in line first in the ticket booth queue can get out first.

This is the opposite of a stack, where data inserted later comes out first.

### Key concepts: FIFO / LILO

Queues follow FIFO/LILO order.
- **FIFO(First In First Out)**: The value that comes in first goes out first.
- **LILO(Last In Last Out)**: The last value entered is the last to go out.

All tasks in the queue are processed in order.
The operation of adding an element from the `rear` of a queue is called `enqueue`, and the operation of removing an element from the `front` of the queue is called `dequeue`.

### Queue states: overflow and underflow

- **Overflow**: 
    - Occurs when you try to add an element to a queue that is already full. In this state, elements cannot be added until some elements are removed.
- **Underflow**: 
    - Occurs when attempting to remove an element from an empty queue. The operation fails because there are no elements to remove.

In both cases, proper error handling is important to prevent your program from crashing or behaving unexpectedly.

## Cue default behavior
---

The stack can be abstracted into the following operations.
- **enqueue(x)**: Adds `x` item to the rear of the queue.
- **dequeue()**: Removes an item from the front of the queue.
- **peek()**: Returns the front item in the queue without removing it.
- **isFull()**: Checks if the queue is full.
- **isEmpty()**: Checks if the queue is empty.

## Queue time complexity
---

- **Enqueue operation: `O(1)`**
    - This is constant time because the element is added to the rear of the queue.
- **Dequeue operation: `O(1)`**
    - It is a constant time because it removes the element at the front of the queue.
- **Access operation: `O(n)`**
    - To access a specific position in a queue, you must traverse from the front of the queue to the desired position.
    - If you approach the rear or front of the queue, it is `O(1)`.
- **Search operation: `O(n)`**
    - It is linear time since all elements in the queue can be traversed.

## Queue implementation
---

There are two ways to implement queues.

### 1. Queue implementation using array
Arrays are a simple way to implement queues.

- Advantages:
    - **Ease of Implementation**: Arrays are easy to understand and use.
    - **Fast Access**: Accessing elements of an array is fast due to direct indexing.
- Disadvantage:
    - **Fixed size**: The biggest disadvantage is that the queue size is fixed when the queue is created. If you need more space, you have to create a new queue and copy the elements, which can be inefficient.

### 2. Use linked list
Linked lists provide a dynamic implementation of a queue, allowing the queue to grow or shrink as needed.

- Advantages: 
    - **Dynamic size**: Queues can grow or shrink as needed, making them more flexible than array-based queues.
    - **Efficient memory usage**: Memory is allocated only when needed.
- Disadvantage : 
    - **Memory Overhead**: Each element requires additional memory for pointers, which can be a disadvantage when managing large amounts of data.

## Queue type
---

There are two types of queues: linear and circular.

### 1. Linear Queue

The basic cue type is a bar-shaped cue.

When implemented as an array, the size is limited and the disadvantage is that all data must be removed or data must be moved one by one to use empty space.
If you have a large number of enqueue and dequeue operations, it may happen that at some point the queue becomes empty and data cannot be inserted.

### 2. Circular Queue

![Circular Queue](/assets/img/posts/DS/5/2.webp "Circular Queue"){:class="img-lg"}

A circular queue is a solution to the problems of linear queues.
A circular cue is created by configuring a one-dimensional array of queues in a `circular` shape and connecting the beginning and end of the array.
This setup ensures consistent use of space and avoids inefficiencies in data movement.

## Use cases for queues
---

1. Used to wait for certain tasks/data to be executed/used in order.
    - ex) CPU scheduling, disk scheduling
2. It is often used to temporarily store data when exchanging data between different threads or processes. (asynchronous transfer)
    - ex) IO buffer, pipe, file IO
