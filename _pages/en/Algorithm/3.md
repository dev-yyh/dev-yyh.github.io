# Jump search concept and implementation
---

Jump search is an algorithm that searches by `moving (jumping)` in `block` units, unlike linear search that searches sequentially.

It can only be used in sorted arrays, and because it does not move one space at a time, it searches fewer elements than linear search.

This algorithm is faster than linear search but slower than binary search.

## How jump navigation works
---

1. Calculate optimal block size (m):
    - Find the block size `m` to divide the array into blocks.
    - The optimal values ​​of m are: where n is the number of elements.
    - `m = √n`

2. Block passing:
    - The algorithm starts at the beginning of the array and moves forward by `m` elements each time. If the value at the end of the current block is less than the target value, it continues to the next block.

3. Perform linear search:
    - Once the block containing the target value is identified, a linear search is performed within that block to find the exact location of the target.

4. Return index or -1:
    - When the target value is found, the algorithm returns its `index`. If all blocks are searched without finding the target, it returns `-1`.


### Process of finding optimal block size
---

The formula for finding the optimal value for `m` is as follows:

If the block size is `m` and has `n` elements, the jump search will search the block a total of `n/m` times.
Since the linear search occurs as many times as `m -1`, a total number of times `n/m + m - 1` are performed.

In this situation, the optimal solution for m can be obtained by the following formula:

When `m` is `√n`, execution can be minimized.

## Example: Process of finding `key = 8`
---

Let's look at the process of finding the value `key = 8` in the array `arr[9] ={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}`.

### 1. Find the block size m.

`m= √11 = 3`

### 2. Search until a block containing the value key is found.
#### 2.1. Check the first block.
Since the maximum value of the block is less than the key value, move to the next block. (`arr[2] < key`)

![Jump search step 2.1](/assets/img/posts/Algorithm/3/2.webp "Jump search step 2.1"){:class="img-lg"}
        
#### 2.2. Check the second block.
Since the maximum value of the block is less than the key value, move to the next block. (`arr[5] < key`)

![Jump search step 2.2](/assets/img/posts/Algorithm/3/3.webp "Jump search step 2.2"){:class="img-lg"}
        
#### 2.3. Check the third block.
The block contains the key value.

### 3. Find the key value using linear search starting from the first index of the third block.

## End condition for jump search
---

There are two termination conditions for jump search. The search will end if any of the following conditions are met.

### 1. If the search is successful
When a block with a search key is found
    
![Jump search success](/assets/img/posts/Algorithm/3/6.webp "Jump search success"){:class="img-lg"}
    
### 2. If search fails
When there are no more blocks to search
        
![Jump search fail](/assets/img/posts/Algorithm/3/7.webp "Jump search fail"){:class="img-lg"}
        

## Jump navigation implementation: Practice in C language

Returns the index of the element if the search is successful, or -1 if the search fails.

```c
int jumpSearch(int arr[], int n, int x)
{
    // Find the block size m for jumping.
    int m = sqrt(n);
 
    int prev = 0;
    // Find the block containing the value x by jumping as much as the block size
    while (arr[(m < n ? m : n) - 1] < x)
    {
        prev = m;
        m += m; // Jump by the block size.
        if (prev >= n) // if array index exceeds, search fails
            return -1;
    }
 
    // If a block containing the value of x is found
    // Linear search starts from the first index of the block
    while (arr[prev] < x)
    {
        prev++;
 
        if (prev == min(m, n)) // If block range is exceeded, search fails
            return -1;
    }

    // If the search value is found
    if (arr[prev] == x)
        return prev;
 
    return -1;
}
```

## Time complexity
---

- Best Case: O(1)
    - When the target element is found at the border of the first block.

- Average/Worst Case: O(√n)
    - When `n` is the number of elements and `m` is the block size, the total number of jump search executions is `n/m + m -1` and the optimal value for `m` is `√n`, so time complexity is `O(√n)`.

        
```text
        Time Complexity = n/m + m - 1
                    = n/√n + √n - 1
                    = 2√n -1
                    = O(√n)
```
