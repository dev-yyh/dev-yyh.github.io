# Learn Linear Search
---

## What is linear search?
---

`Linear Search` is also called `Sequential Search`.

This is an algorithm that searches a list sequentially to find the desired value.

Linear search has the advantage of being easy to implement and operating regardless of whether the list is sorted, but it has the disadvantage of being inefficient if the length of the list to be searched is long because all elements of the list must be checked.

## Time complexity
---

Best Case : O(1)
- If the item is found on the first try.

Average Case : O(n)
- On average you may need to search half the list.

Worst Case : O(n)
- The item may be the last item in the list or not at all.

## End condition
---

There are two termination conditions for linear search. The search will end if any of the following conditions are met.

1. If search fails
    - When the end of the list is passed without finding the value to search for
      ![Search failed](/assets/img/posts/Algorithm/1/2.webp "Sequential Search (Search failed)"){:class="img-lg"}

2. If the search is successful
    - When an element equal to the value to be searched is found in the list.
      ![Search Success](/assets/img/posts/Algorithm/1/3.webp "Sequential Search (Search Success)"){:class="img-lg"}
    
## Implementation
---

Implementation with the above termination condition is as follows.

If the search fails, it returns `-1`, if it succeeds it returns the `index i` of the element.

```c
int sequentialSearch(int[] arr, int n, int key) {
  int i = 0;

  while (ture) {
    if(i==n) return -1;  // End condition 1. Search failure

    if(arr[i] == key) return i; // End condition 2. Search success

    i++;
  }
}
```

The above implementation method determines two termination conditions each time the search is repeated.

This can cause unnecessary overhead, especially for long lists.

## Optimization using Sentinel method
---

The `Sentinel method` is used as a way to reduce the number of inspections.
Places a special value called `Sentinel` at the end of the list. This value serves as a flag to signal when the search should be stopped, thus reducing the number of judgments by removing the search failure condition among the termination conditions.

Here's how to apply it:
1. Add the value you want to search for as Sentinel at the end of the list.
2. We start searching the list, knowing that the Sentinel value ensures that the loop ends.

### Search successful

## Sentinel Linear Search
---

Linear search using the `Sentinel method` is called `Sentinel Linear Search`.


The implementation is as follows:

```c
int sequentialSearch(int[] arr, int n, int key) {
  int i = 0;

  arr[n] = key;  // add sentry value to the end of the array

  while (ture) {
    if(arr[i] == key) break; // End condition 2. Search success

    i++;
  }
  return i == n ? -1 : i; // If it is a sentry value, -1 is returned, otherwise, the index of the element is returned.
}
```

When the loop is completed, this statement determines whether the value found is the original data of the array or a sentinel value and returns the value.

If it is a `sentinel value (i==n)`, there is no searched value, so `-1` is returned. Otherwise, the search is successful, so `index of element` is returned.

In Sentinel Linear Search, you can see that the number of judgments has been reduced by half by removing `End condition 1` from the loop.
