# Learn about Interpolation Search
---

Interpolation Search is a very efficient search algorithm in sorted arrays. 
This algorithm searches a sorted list by reducing its range. The operation method is similar to binary search, but the method of determining the search position is different.

It provides faster performance than traditional binary search, especially when the data is uniformly distributed.

## Binary search vs interpolation search
---

### Binary search
In binary search, the search range is halved each time. The intermediate position is calculated as follows:

$$ \text{pos} = \frac{\text{low} + \text{high}}{2} $$

### Interpolation navigation
Interpolated search estimates the search location based on the value you are looking for (x). The calculation formula is as follows:

$$
\text{pos} = \text{low} + \left( \frac{x - \text{arr[low]}}{\text{arr[high]} - \text{arr[low]}} \right ) \times (\text{high} - \text{low})
$$

#### Here:
- `arr` is an array containing data
- `low` is the starting index of the arr array
- `high` is the last index of the arr array
- `x` is the search value
- `pos` is the index of the search position.

Binary search and interpolation search formulas work under the assumption that the data is linearly distributed.

Binary search always checks the middle of the range, but interpolated search can jump directly to a closer location depending on the data distribution.

## Derivation of interpolation search formula
---

![Interpolation Search](/assets/img/posts/Algorithm/4/2.webp "Interpolation Search")

Interpolation exploration assumes that the data follows a linear relationship. This is similar to the equation of a straight line.

$$
y = m \times x + c
$$

### Step-by-step guidance process:

![Interpolation Search formula](/assets/img/posts/Algorithm/4/3.webp "Interpolation Search formula"){:class="img-lg"}

1. Use the equation of a straight line for three points (`low`, `pos`, `high`).

    $$
    \text{arr[high]} = m \times \text{high} + c \quad (1) \\
    \text{arr[low]} = m \times \text{low} + c \quad (2) \\
    x = m \times \text{pos} + c \quad (3)
    $$

2. The slope (`m`) is expressed as follows.
   
    $$
    m = \frac{\text{arr[high]} - \text{arr[low]}}{\text{high} - \text{low}}
    $$
   
3. Substituting formula (2) into formula (3), it is expressed as follows.

    $$
    x = m \times \text{pos} + \text{arr[low]} - m \times \text{low} \\
    m \times \text{pos} = m \times \text{low} + x - \text{arr[low]} \\
    \text{pos} = \text{low} + \frac{(x - \text{arr[low]})}{m} \quad (4)
    $$

4. Substituting the slope (`m`) into formula (4) becomes the formula for finding the search position.

    $$
    \text{pos} = \text{low} + \left( \frac{x - \text{arr[low]}}{\text{arr[high]} - \text{arr[low]}} \right ) \times (\text{high} - \text{low})
    $$

This formula provides the index (pos) at which the search key is expected to be located, making interpolated search very efficient on linearly distributed data.

## How interpolation search works
---

Interpolated search, like binary search, only works on sorted arrays. The navigation process consists of the following steps:

1. Calculate the navigation position (pos).
2. Compare the navigation key (x) and (arr[pos]) values.
   - If `arr[pos] = x`, the search succeeds and ends.
   - If `arr[pos] < x`, the search targets the right section of the array based on the search position. (`low = pos + 1`)
   - If `arr[pos] > x`, the search targets the left section of the array based on the search position. (`high = pos - 1`)
3. Iterate and continue searching until a value is found or the range is invalid.

## Example: Process of finding `x = 32`
---

Let's look at the process of finding the value of `x = 32` using interpolation search.

### 1. Find the search position (`pos`).

$$
\text{pos} = \text{low} + \frac{(x - \text{arr[low]}) \times (\text{high} - \text{low})}{\text{arr[high ]} - \text{arr[low]}} \\
= 0 + \frac{(32 - 5) \times (9 - 0)}{(60 - 5)} = 4.42 \approx 4
$$

![Interpolation Search step1](/assets/img/posts/Algorithm/4/4.webp "Interpolation Search step1")

### 2. Compare `arr[pos]` with the search value.

Since arr[pos] < x, the right section of the array is set as the search range. 

$$
\text{low} = \text{pos} + 1 = 4 + 1 =5
$$

![Interpolation Search step2](/assets/img/posts/Algorithm/4/5.webp "Interpolation Search step2")

### 3. Find the search position (`pos`).

$$
\text{pos} = \text{low} + \frac{(x - \text{arr[low]}) \times (\text{high} - \text{low})}{\text{arr[high ]} - \text{arr[low]}} \\
= 5 + \frac{(32 - 32) \times (9 - 5)}{(60 - 32)} = 5
$$

![Interpolation Search step3](/assets/img/posts/Algorithm/4/6.webp "Interpolation Search step3")

### 4. Compare `arr[pos]` with the search value.

Since `arr[pos] = x`, the search ends.

## End condition
---

Interpolation search ends in two cases:

1. **If the search is successful**:
    - When a search value is found
    - `arr[pos] == key`
2. **If search fails**: 
    - When out of search range
    - `x < arr[low] && x > arr[high]`

## Implementation of interpolation search: Practice in C language
---

There are two ways to implement interpolated navigation: using iteration and using recursion.

### 1. Implementation using iteration

```c
int interpolationSearch(int arr[], int n, int x) {
    int low = 0, high = n - 1, pos;

    while (arr[low] != arr[high] && x >= arr[low] && x <= arr[high]) {
        pos = low + (((double)(high - low) / (arr[high] - arr[low])) * (x - arr[low]));

        if (arr[pos] == x)
            return pos;
        else if (arr[pos] > x)
            high = pos - 1;
        else
            low = pos + 1;
    }

    return (arr[low] == x) ? low : -1;
}
```

### 2. Implementation using recursion

```c
int interpolationSearch(int arr[], int low, int high, int x) {
    if (arr[low] > x || arr[high] < x)
        return -1;

    int pos = low + (((double)(high - low) / (arr[high] - arr[low])) * (x - arr[low]));

    if (arr[pos] == x)
        return pos;
    else if (x < arr[pos])
        return interpolationSearch(arr, low, pos - 1, x);
    else
        return interpolationSearch(arr, pos + 1, high, x);
}
```

## Time Complexity
---

- Best Case: O(1)
    - This is if you find it at once.

- Average Case: O(log(log n))
    - This is when the data is uniformly distributed.

- Worst Case: O(n)
    - This is a case where the data is unevenly distributed.
