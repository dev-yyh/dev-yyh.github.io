# What is an array?
---

An array is a collection of data stored sequentially in a contiguous memory space.

Most programming languages ​​store the same type of data. For example, if an array is of type "int", it can only store integer elements and cannot store elements of other types such as double, float, char, etc.

Each value that makes up the array is called an `element`, and the number indicating the position in the array is called an `index`.

## Array expression
---

Let's declare an array in C.

![Array](/assets/img/posts/DS/2/1.webp "Array"){:class="img-lg"}

The above arrangement is expressed graphically as follows.

![Array2](/assets/img/posts/DS/2/2.webp "Array2"){:class="img-lg"}

The facts that can be seen from the picture are as follows.

- Sequential storage:
    - Data is stored sequentially in continuous memory space.
- 0-based indexing:
    - In C (and many other languages), array indices start at 0. So array[0] is the first element and array[9] is the last element. And each element can be accessed through its index.
- Fixed size:
    - An array can store exactly 10 elements, no more, no less.

## Time complexity of array
---

- Read(Access): 
    - Best/average/worst case: O(1)
        - You can access any element directly through its index, which takes the same amount of time regardless of the size of the array.

-Insert: 
    - Best case: O(1)
        - If you insert it at the end of the array (if there is space), no movement is required.
    - Average/worst case: O(n)
        - To insert it somewhere else you have to move the element, or in the worst case you have to move all the elements (if they were inserted in the first place).

- Delete: 
    - Best case: O(1)
        - If you delete the last element, no movement is required.
    - Average/worst case: O(n)
        - You have to move the element to delete it somewhere else, and in the worst case you have to move all the elements (if you deleted the first one).

-Search: 
    - Best case: O(1)
        - If the element you want to search for is at the beginning of the array.
    - Average/worst case: O(n)
        - If an element is at the end of the array or not in the array, the entire array must be searched.

## Main characteristics of arrays
---

Arrays have several properties:
1. They have the same data type.
    - There are programming languages ​​that mainly have the same data type, but can also support heterogeneous data.
    - A collection of heterogeneous data is usually called a `record`.
2. The time to access each element of the array is O(1), which is the same.
    - All elements can be accessed using the `basic position + offset (element size * index)` operation.
3. Data is stored as a single block in contiguous memory.
    - Almost no space is wasted.
    - However, in case of a large array, it may not be possible to allocate the necessary memory.
4. Indexing and slicing are possible.
    - Because data is physically stored sequentially in real memory, an index exists and `indexing` (reading a specific element from a list using an index) is possible, and `slicing` (separating and manipulating a specific part of an element separately) is possible. It is possible to do this.

## Advantages and disadvantages of using arrays
---

### Advantages
1. Quick access:
    - Access using index is possible, so you can quickly access all elements.
2. Space efficiency:
    - Since the recording density is 1, there is less wasted space.
    - Lists, graphs, etc. have additional information such as pointers in addition to data, so the recording density is less than 1.
    - Because arrays only store data without additional information, the recording density is 1.
3. Simplicity:
    - Arrays are simple to use.

### disadvantage
1. Fixed size:
    - Once an array is declared, its size cannot be changed. This flexibility may be lacking if you need to store more data than expected.
2. Costly insertion/deletion:
    - Adding or removing elements in the middle of an array can be time consuming as it requires moving other elements.
3. Memory allocation:
    - Because the size of an array is mostly determined statically, it is difficult to determine the appropriate size of the array in advance in situations where insertions and deletions occur dynamically, which may result in overflow or waste of storage space.

## When should you use arrays?
---

1. Sequential data storage:
    - Suitable when the order of elements is important.
2. Multidimensional data:
    - Suitable for matrices, grids, or any data with more than one dimension.
3. Need quick access:
    - Suitable for quickly searching for specific elements.
4. Stable data size:
    - Ideal when the number of elements does not change frequently.
