# Learn about Stack
---

## What is Stack?
---

A stack is a linear structure in which data can be added or removed from only one end.

Plates piled up in restaurants are a good example. Plates stacked in order resemble a stack structure.
When plates are needed, the top plate is used first, and the bottom plate is used last.

### Key concepts: LIFO / FILO

The stack follows LIFO/FILO order.
- **LIFO(Last In, First Out)**: The last input value is the first output.
- **FILO(First In, Last Out)**: The first value entered is the last to go out.

All operations on the stack occur only at one end of the stack, called `Top`.

### Stack states: overflow and underflow

- **Overflow**: 
    - Occurs when you try to push (add) an element to a stack that is already full. In this state, elements cannot be added until some elements are removed.
- **Underflow**: 
    - Occurs when you try to pop (remove) an element from an empty stack. The operation fails because there are no elements to remove.

In both cases, proper error handling is important to prevent your program from crashing or behaving unexpectedly.


## Abstract Data Type (ADT)
---

The stack can be abstracted into the following operations.
- **push(x)**: Adds item `x` to the top of the stack.
- **pop()**: Removes the item from the top of the stack.
- **peek() or top()**: Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
- **isEmpty()**: Checks if the stack is empty.
- **isFull()**: Checks if the stack is full (for fixed size stacks).
- **getSize()**: Returns the current number of elements in the stack.

## Stack default behavior

### Push operation 

The operation of pushing data onto the stack is called `push`. push goes through the following steps:

1. Check if it is full: 
    - First check if the stack is full. If it is full, an `overflow` error will occur.
2. Top Increment: 
    - If the stack is not full, increment the `Top` index to point to the next available location.
3. Add data: 
    - Places a new item at the location pointed to by `Top`.

### Pop operations

The operation of removing data from the stack is called `pop`. pop goes through the following steps:

1. Check if it is empty: 
    - First check if the stack is empty. If it is empty, an `underflow` error will occur.
2. Data removal: 
    - If the stack is not empty, remove the item pointed to by Top.
3. Decrease the top: 
    - Decrease the `Top` index to point to the new Top of the stack.

### Peek operation

The `peek` operation allows you to see the item on the top of the stack without removing it.
This is useful when you need to see the most recent item added to the stack without changing the contents of the stack.

### IsEmpty and IsFull operations
1. **isEmpty**: 
    - Returns true if there are no elements on the stack, otherwise returns false. This is useful for checking before performing a pop operation.
2. **isFull**: 
    - Returns true if the stack has reached its maximum capacity (relative to fixed-size stacks), otherwise returns false. This is important before the push operation.

## Stack time complexity
---

- **Push operation: `O(1)`**
    - It is constant time because we are adding an element above Top.
- **Pop operation: `O(1)`**
    - This is constant time because it only removes the Top element.
- **Top/Peek operation: `O(1)`** 
    - It is constant time because we are simply accessing the Top element.
- **Search operation: `O(n)`** 
    - It is linear time since any element in the stack can be traversed.

### Why stack operations are efficient

Stack operations are efficient because they only involve adding, removing, or accessing elements at the Top.
There is no need to traverse the entire stack or move elements, so the time complexity of these operations remains constant.

## Stack implementation
---

There are two ways to implement a stack:

### 1. Stack implementation using arrays
Arrays are a simple way to implement a stack.

- Advantages:
    - **Ease of Implementation**: Arrays are easy to understand and use.
    - **Fast Access**: Accessing elements of an array is fast due to direct indexing.
- Disadvantage:
    - **Fixed Size**: The biggest disadvantage is that the stack size is fixed when the stack is created. If you need a larger stack, you have to create a new stack and copy the elements, which can be inefficient.


### 2. Use linked list
Linked lists provide a dynamic implementation of the stack, allowing you to grow or shrink the stack as needed.

- Advantages: 
    - **Dynamic size**: Stacks can grow or shrink as needed, making them more flexible than array-based stacks.
    - **Efficient memory usage**: Memory is allocated only when needed.
- Disadvantage : 
    - **Memory Overhead**: Each element requires additional memory for pointers, which can be a disadvantage when managing large amounts of data.

## Use cases of Stack
---

1. **Recursive function call**: 
    - The system call stack keeps track of active functions. Each time a function is called, it is pushed onto the stack and popped when it returns.
2. **Undo mechanism**: 
    - Every time you change something, it gets pushed onto the stack. Undoing a change removes the last action from the stack and reverts it.
3. **Browser History**: 
    - Web browsers use stacks to track which pages you visit. Clicking "Back" removes the current page from the stack and loads the previous page.
4. **Expression parsing**: 
    - The stack is used to parse expressions (e.g. converting infix notation to postfix notation), evaluate postfix expressions, or process expressions in languages ​​such as calculators.
5. **Backtracking Problem**:
    - Stacks are used to solve backtracking problems.
