# What is a thread?
---

A thread is a unit of flow that executes within a process.

A typical program typically runs with a single thread, but depending on its design and requirements, it may use multiple threads to perform various tasks simultaneously. 
This approach is called `multi-thread`.

## Thread structure
---

All threads within a process share common resources such as code, data, and operating system resources such as open files and signals.

Each thread in a program has a unique thread ID, program counter (PC), register set, and stack. 

The reason each thread has its own resources (PC, register set, stack) is to add independent function calls and execution flow.

This allows different threads to perform different tasks simultaneously without interfering with each other.

## Key differences between processes and threads
---

The main difference is that within the same process, threads share the same memory space, whereas processes run in separate memory spaces.

This shared memory space allows threads to communicate more easily, but can cause problems if one thread overwrites another thread's memory space.

## Advantages and disadvantages of using threads
---

### Benefits of using Threads
1. Increased user responsiveness
    - By splitting a process into multiple threads, even if some threads are delayed, other threads can continue to work, keeping the application responsive.
2. Improve performance with multiprocessing
    - Threads allow tasks to be executed in parallel on multi-core processors. This can significantly improve performance as multiple threads can be processed simultaneously on different CPU cores.
3. Efficient use of resources
    - Threads share resources within a process, reducing the cost of additional resource allocation and context switches compared to using multiple processes.
4. Easy to communicate
    - Unlike inter-process communication, which requires special techniques (IPC), threads can easily exchange data because they share the same memory space.

### Disadvantages of using threads
1. Potential for instability
    - Because threads share the same memory space, one thread can accidentally overwrite memory used by another thread, which can lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
2. Complexity of synchronization
    - Managing multiple threads requires careful `synchronization` to avoid problems such as `race conditions`, `deadlock`, etc., which can complicate the development and debugging process.

## Thread type
---

Threads can be implemented in a variety of ways depending on the operating system, but they generally fall into three categories:

### 1. User-Level Thread
User threads are supported high up in the kernel realm and are typically implemented through user-level libraries.
In this case, the kernel is not aware of the existence of the thread, so there is no intervention from the kernel.

Since multiple user-level threads are mapped to one kernel-level thread, it is called a `many-to-one (n:1)` thread mapping.

- Advantages
    - It is created and managed in the user area, so it is fast.
    - Portability is high because it does not require kernel intervention. (Can run on any operating system)

- Disadvantage
    - Since the kernel determines that there is only one thread, if one thread is interrupted, all other threads are also interrupted.

### 2. Kernel-Level Thread
Kernel-level threads are implemented as thread functions supported by the operating system, and the kernel manages the creation and scheduling of threads.

User-level threads and kernel-level threads are mapped `one-to-one (1:1)`. So when you create a user-level thread, it automatically creates a corresponding kernel thread.

- Advantages
    - Because the kernel manages each thread individually, threads within a process can run in parallel.
    - Therefore, even if one thread stops, other threads can continue performing.

- Disadvantage
    - Creation and management are slower than user threads.

### 3. Mixed thread
It is a structure that mixes user-level threads and kernel-level threads. This is a way to overcome the shortcomings of user-level threads and kernel-level threads.

User-level threads are mapped many-to-many to lightweight processes similar to kernel-level threads, and lightweight processes are mapped one-to-one to kernel-level threads. Ultimately, many kernel threads are mapped `many-to-many (n:m)` to many user-level threads.

- Advantages
    - Threads within a process can run in parallel
    - Reduces overhead in one-to-one thread mapping through `thread pooling` technique.

- Disadvantage
    - Complex to implement and manage.
