# Understanding binary search.
---

Binary search is an algorithm that finds search values ​​by narrowing the search range in a sorted list.

Binary search has the disadvantage that it can only be used on sorted lists, but it has the advantage of being fast because the search range is halved each time the search is repeated.

Let's find out how this algorithm works, why it is efficient, and how you can implement it yourself.

## How binary search works
---

The binary search algorithm finds the search value by comparing it to the middle value of the list.
Since we need to find the middle value, it can only be used on sorted arrays.

Here's how binary search works: 

1. Get the middle value of an array.
2. Compare the median and search values.
    1. If the middle value is equal to the search value, exit. (`mid = key`)
    2. If the search value is greater than the median value, search for the right section of the array based on the median value. (`mid < key`)
    3. If the search value is smaller than the median value, search for the left section of the array based on the median value. (`mid > key`)
3. Repeat until the value is found or the gap is empty.

## Example: Process of finding `key = 32`
---

Let's look at the process of finding the value `key = 32` using binary search.

### 1. First, determine the center of the array.

```text
mid = low + (high - low) / 2
    = 0 + (9-0)/2
    = 4
```

### 2. Compare the median and search values.
Since `A [4] < key`, the right section of the array is set as the search range.

```text
low = mid + 1
    = 4 + 1
    = 5
```

![Binary search step 2](/assets/img/posts/Algorithm/2/1.webp "Binary search step 2"){:class="img-lg"}

### 3. Determine the median value.

text
mid = 5+ (9-5)/2
    = 7


![Binary search step 3](/assets/img/posts/Algorithm/2/3.webp "Binary search step 3"){:class="img-lg"}

### 4. Compare the median and search values.
Since `A [7] > key`, the left section of the array is set as the search range.

```text
high = mid -1
     = 7 - 1
     = 6
```

![Binary search step 4](/assets/img/posts/Algorithm/2/4.webp "Binary search step 4"){:class="img-lg"}

### 5. Determine the median value.

```text
mid = 5 + (6-5)/2
    = 5
```

![Binary search step 5](/assets/img/posts/Algorithm/2/5.webp "Binary search step 5"){:class="img-lg"}

### 6. Compare the median and search values.
Since `A [5] = key` we end the search.

## Time complexity
---

- Best Case: O(1)
    - If the item is found on the first try.

- Average/Worst Case: O(log n)
    - This is because the search range is reduced by half at each step.

## End condition for binary search
---

There are two termination conditions for binary search. The search will end if any of the following conditions are met.

### 1. If the search is successful
This is when an element that is the same as the value to search for (`a[mid] == key`) is found in the list.

![Binary search success](/assets/img/posts/Algorithm/2/6.webp "Binary search success"){:class="img-lg"}

### 2. If search fails
This is when there is no longer a range to search (`low > high`).

![Binary search fail](/assets/img/posts/Algorithm/2/7.webp "Binary search fail"){:class="img-lg"}

## Binary search implementation: Practice in C language
---

Let’s implement it using the above termination condition.

There are two implementation methods for binary search.
### 1. How to use loops
```c
int binarySearch (int arr[], int low, int high, int key) {
  while (low <= high) {
    int mid = low + (high-low) / 2;
    
    if (arr[mid] == key) // Successful search for termination condition 1.
      return mid; 
    else if (arr[mid] > key) 
      high = mid - 1;      
    else 
      low = mid + 1;
  }
  return -1 ; // End condition 2 (low > high) search failed.
}
```

### 2. Method using recursive functions
```c
int binarySearch (int arr[], int low, int high, int key) {
  
  if (low > high) // End condition 2 search failed.
    return -1;  

  int mid = low + (high-low)/2;

  if (arr[mid] == key) // Successful search for termination condition 1.
    return mid;
  else if (arr[mid] > key)
    return binarySearch(arr, low, mid-1, key);
  else
    return binarySearch(arr, mid+1, high, key);
}
```

## Tip: How to find the median value
---

Let's look at two ways to find the median value.

1. `int mid = low + (high - low) / 2`
2. `int mid = (low + high) / 2`

The second method is that if the `low + high` value is greater than the range of int values ​​(`2^31 -1`), it will overflow with a negative value.
This can be problematic because dividing this negative value by 2 makes the mid value negative.

If the `low + high` value is out of range, you must find the intermediate value using the first method.
Otherwise, the second method is more efficient than the first method because the computation is simpler.
